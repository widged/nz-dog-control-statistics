# Description

Dog control information

The dog control profile pages contain statistics about dog control throughout New Zealand. A similar set of profile pages is provided for those territorial authorities that have dog control statistics available. These may be accessed through each council's main profile page .


This information has been collected from three sources:

* dog, owner, registration and infringement information from the National Dog Database (NDD) at the Department of Internal Affairs
* dog-related injury claims and their cost from the Accident Compensation Corporation
* prosecutions and dog destruction orders under the Dog Control Act 1996 from the Ministry of Justice
