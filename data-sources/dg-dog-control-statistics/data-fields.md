# Menacing dogs

https://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-Dog-Control-Dog-Control-Amendment-Act-2003?OpenDocument

Category of ‘menacing dog’. A council may declare a dog to be menacing if it considers that the dog could pose a threat to any person, stock, poultry, domestic animal, or protected wildlife because of:
* any observed or reported behaviour of the dog
* any characteristics typically associated with the dog’s breed or type

a council must classify a dog as menacing if it has reasonable grounds to believe that a dog belongs wholly or predominately to one or more of the four breeds/types banned from importation into New Zealand.

menacing dogs must be muzzled when in public and may be required by the council to be neutered.

# Dangerous dogs

http://www.animalcontrol.org.nz/Dangerous_Dog_FAQs.html

Councils can classify a dog as dangerous if

* the owner is convicted of an offence where their dog has rushed at someone and caused harm or damage
* on the basis of sworn evidence, the dog is believed to be a threat to public safety
* the owner has admitted in writing that the dog is a threat to public safety.

Councils must classify a dog as dangerous if the owner has been convicted of an offence relating to harm or damage and no destruction order has been made.

Dangerous dogs are required to be kept within a fully fenced area, neutered and muzzled and kept on a leash in public places.

Probationary and Disqualified Dog Owners

As a dog owner, you will be classified as a probationary owner if:

You have received three or more infringement notices within a two-year period, or have been convicted of any offence under the Dog Control Act 1996. This means that:

* The probationary owner status will apply for two years.
* Any dog not registered at the time of the classification must be re-homed or disposed of within 14 days.
* Any dog already registered may be kept by the owner but the registration fees may incur a 50% surcharge.
* As a probationary owner you may be required to take dog owner education training and/or dog obedience classes.

Anybody who has received three or more infringement notices within a two-year period, or who has been convicted of any offence under the Dog Control Act 1996 may also be classified as a disqualified owner. This means that:

* You may not be allowed to own a dog for up to five years from the time of disqualification.
* Any dog owned by you as a disqualified owner must be re-homed or put down within 14 days. Transferring ownership of a dog to another person at the same address is not acceptable.
* Any owner not adhering to these conditions may be fined up to $3,000 and have their disqualification period extended by a further five years.

councils may disqualify someone from owning a dog or declare them to be a probationary owner if they incur more than three infringement offences within two years or are convicted of an offence (not being an infringement offence) under the Dog Control Act, Parts 1 and 2 of the Animal Welfare Act 1999, section 26ZZP of the Conservation Act 1987, or section 56I of the National Parks Act 1980.

As an owner you can be prosecuted and, if convicted, fined up to $3000 if your dog is responsible for a serious attack.
In addition you will be liable for any charges for any damages that occur.
Dogs risk being impounded and/or destroyed if they attack people, animals and protected wildlife.
Your dog will be required to wear a muzzle. If that requirement is not adhered to, you may be fined an additional $3,000 and your dog may be destroyed.

# Micro-chipping

http://www.animalcontrol.org.nz/Dog_Registration.html

Since 1 July 2006, all dogs registered in New Zealand for the first time (except farm dogs used for stock control) must be microchipped. This applies mainly to puppies when they are first registered at three months. Dogs classified as dangerous or menacing, dogs impounded but not registered and dogs registered but impounded twice are also required to be microchipped.

https://www.dia.govt.nz/diawebsite.nsf/wpg_URL/Resource-material-Dog-Control-Dog-Control-Amendment-Act-2003?OpenDocument

All dogs first registered on or after 1 July 2006 (except working farm dogs) and all dogs classified as dangerous or menacing since 1 December 2003 are required to be microchipped. Dangerous and menacing dogs classified before 1 July 2006, had to be microchipped within two months of that date. Unregistered dogs released from pounds after 1 July 2006 are required to be microchipped, and registered dogs impounded twice by the territorial authority are also required to be microchipped.
